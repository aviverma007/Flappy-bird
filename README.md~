#  Flappy Bird

Simple flappy bird app for android.

I made this at the start of winter break because I wanted to see how much I could do in a few hours without any tutorials or a game engine like Unity. Right now, it's pretty incomplete but at least workable. I will optimize it and polish it when I have time. 

## Todo:

Rotate bird (probably use a table instead of rotating each frame because matrix calculations are expensive I think)

Make pipes fill screen (just make image longer?)

Draw own sprites (or make daniel do it)
